Rok Drummer v1.5.0 source code as of September 12, 2015.

Distributed as "Rok Drummer Lite" source code because all encryption/decryption and proprietary C3 information has been scrubbed. This is the only way I could share the source code and the program hopefully will live on.

I can't and will not provide any support. But I'm sure there are talented people out there who can make good use of this.
